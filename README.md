# Automate-looking-for-the-best-price  

This program is a price scraper.

You shoul add a link to the product you want for a cheaper price, your email login and password and also the price that you're looking for.

If it's so you'll got an email that informs you about the price reduction 

As an example I've used the lamoda store link
